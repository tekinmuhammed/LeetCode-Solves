# 3480. Maximize Subarrays After Removing One Conflicting Pair

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Problem Link:** [LeetCode 3480](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-subarrays-after-removing-one-conflicting-pair/)

---

## Problem Description

You are given:
- An integer `n`, representing a list of numbers from `1` to `n`.
- A list of `conflictingPairs`, where each pair `[a, b]` means that `a` and `b` **cannot appear in the same subarray**.

You are allowed to **remove one conflicting pair** from the list.

Return the **maximum total number of valid subarrays** (continuous subarrays of `[1, 2, ..., n]`) possible **after** removing **at most one conflicting pair**.

---

### Example

**Input:**
```python
n = 5
conflictingPairs = [[1,3], [2,4], [1,5]]
```

**Output:**
```python
11
```

### Explanation:

- After removing the pair `[1, 5]`, the number of valid subarrays becomes 11.

- Valid subarrays are those that do not contain any conflicting pair.

### Approach
This is a **range restriction + greedy optimization** problem.

### Key Ideas:

- For each index `a` in the conflicting pairs, track the **two smallest values** of `b` that conflict with it.
(Using `bMin1[a]` and `bMin2[a]`).

- We want to partition the array in such a way that we can **maximize the number of valid subarrays**.

- Traverse from right to left, updating the minimum conflict boundaries.

- At each position, calculate how many valid subarrays end at that index.

- Also track how much each possible removal could improve the total, and **remove the one with highest benefit**.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n + k)`, where `k` = number of conflicting pairs

- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

### Notes

- The key trick is understanding how conflicts reduce the number of valid subarrays and how removing one optimal pair helps restore more.

- This is an advanced greedy algorithm requiring detailed conflict tracking.
