---

## Problem Description

Given two sorted integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, and an integer `k`, return the **k-th smallest product** of `nums1[i] * nums2[j]` where `0 <= i < nums1.length` and `0 <= j < nums2.length`.

---

## Example

### Input:
```python
nums1 = [2,5]
nums2 = [3,4]
k = 2
```

### Output:
`10`

### Explanation:
The products are `[6, 8, 10, 20]`, and the 2nd smallest is `10`.

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 5 * 10^4`

- `-10^5 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^5`

- `nums1` and `nums2` are **non-decreasing**

- `1 <= k <= nums1.length * nums2.length`

### Approach

This problem requires finding the k-th smallest product in a **virtual sorted array** of all possible products between elements in two sorted arrays, which is too large to generate explicitly. Hence, we apply **binary search** on the product values.

### Key Ideas:
- Binary search over the **value space** instead of the index space.

- For a guessed product value `v`, compute how many products are `<= v`.

- - This is done using two-pointer/binary search logic depending on the sign of the current element.

- Adjust the search range based on whether the count is less than or greater than `k`.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n1 * log n2 * log(max_product_range))`

- - For each binary search iteration (`~60` steps), we traverse all of `nums1` and binary search in `nums2`.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

No extra space except primitive variables.

### Notes
- Special care is needed when handling negative numbers and division in Python.

- This solution efficiently handles large arrays by avoiding the explicit computation of all possible products.
